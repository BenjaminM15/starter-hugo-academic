Benjamin Malo is a PhD student in medical anthropology at Université Laval. His main research interests include vaccine hesitancy, complementary and alternative medicines, and the Internet. His current doctoral project focuses on the vaccination informational context in the era of the Web 2.0. More specifically, it focuses on the ways in which parents' reflexivity about vaccination and infectious diseases is modulated by online risk representations. It also examines how these dynamics are embedded in a broader context of loss of trust in expertise and democratic institutions. Benjamin Malo is also a qualitative research officer in Eve Dubé's team at Centre de recherche du CHU de Québec-Université Laval.
